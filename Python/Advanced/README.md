---------------About the course-----------------

The "Python Advanced" course builds on Python language skills by exploring more complex concepts typical of the language. 
In the course, students learn to create linear data structures, to solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), 
they will work with stacks and queues (Stacks & Queues), tuples and sets (Tuples & Sets), matrices (Multidimensional Lists), 
as well as and files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. 
It will take a deeper look at recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments.
