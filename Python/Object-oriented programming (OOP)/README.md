The Python OOP course teaches students the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), 
working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. 
Basic principles of OOP such as 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀), 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘀𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗶𝗻𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗼𝗹𝘆𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗵𝗶𝘀𝗺 are studied.
They enter the most frequently used 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀 (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns).
They are introduced to 𝗦𝗢𝗟𝗜𝗗 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 for object-oriented software design. 
They learn what 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 are and how to use them. 
They learn how to create and use 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀. 
They pay attention to component testing (𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀) and the concept of	𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (𝗧𝗗𝗗).
