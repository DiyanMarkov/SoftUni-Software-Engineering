The Python OOP course teaches students the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), 
working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. 
Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are studied.
They enter the most frequently used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns).
They are introduced to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. 
They learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. 
They learn how to create and use decorators. 
They pay attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
